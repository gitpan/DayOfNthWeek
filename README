Date/DayOfNthWeek version 1.0
==============================

This is a simple Perl module for finding the first, last or
the Nth Tuesday (or any other day) of the month.

Has three functions:

	first_week($); # day is in the first week of the month

Takes an int between 0 and 6 and returns 1 if today is 
the first (Sun .. Sat) of the month 

	last_week($);  # day is in the last week of the month

Takes an int between 0 and 6 and returns 1 if today is 
the last (Sun .. Sat) of the month 

	day_week($$); # day is in the Nth week of the month

Takes an int between 0 and 6 [Sun - Sat] and an int for week of the
month [1-6].  Returns 1 if today is the that day of the Nth week of
the month.

I wrote this to send out use in a cron job to send out reminders about
the Morris County Perl Mongers monthly meetings.  Using Date::Calc and
Date::Manip were more than what I needed.

I am using this to send out a reminder about the Morris County Perl
Mongers meetings.  We meet in a local Irish Pub on the 3rd Tuesday of
the month.

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use Date::DayOfNthWeek qw(day_week);

my $d = 2; # set to the day of week I want SUNDAY=0
my $w = 2; # set to the week PRIOR to the meeting so I can send out the reminder

my $ok = day_week($d,$w);

if ($ok) { &nextweek; }
else     {
    my $ww = $w+1;             # keeps me from changing the value of $w 
	if ($ww > 6) { $ww = 1; }  # fixes range input errors for wrapping to next month
	$ok = day_week($d,$ww);
	if ($ok) { &tonight; }
	else {
		$d--;                   # see if this is the day before the meeting
		if ($d < 0) { $d = 6; } # fixes range input error for wrapping to previous week day
		$ok = day_week($d,$w);
		&tomorrow if $ok;		
	}
} 

sub nextweek { print "Meeting is next week\n"; }
sub tomorrow { print "Meeting is tomorrow\n";  }
sub tonight  { print "Meeting is tonight\n";   }
